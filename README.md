An analogy (book):

Suppose you use a ride-sharing app because you need to get somewhere. When you order a trip, you usually don't care how the car looks or who the driver is. 
You just need to get somewhere. In my case, I don't care whether a car or a spaceship comes to pick me up if I reach the destination in time. The ride-sharing 
app is an interface. The customer doesn't request a car or a driver, but a trip. Any driver with a car who can offer the service can answer the customer's request.
The customer and the driver are decoupled through the app (interface); the customer doesn't know who the driver is nor which car will pick them up before a car 
responds to their request, and the driver doesn't need to know who they do the service for. 

Using this analogy, you can deduce the role of interfaces in relationship with objects in Java.
