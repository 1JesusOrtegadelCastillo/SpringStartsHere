Circular Dependency

A circular dependency, Spring needs to create a bean of type Parrot. But because Parrot has a dependency Person,
Spring needs firsts to create a Person. However, to create a Person, Spring already needs to have built Parrot.
Spring is now in a deadlock. It cannot create a Parrot because it needs a Person, and it cannot create a Person
because it needs a Parrot.


Output:

Caused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.UnsatisfiedDependencyException: Error creating bean with name 'person'
defined in file ... Unsatisfied dependency expressed through constructor parameter 0;
nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCurrentlyInCreationException: Error creating bean with name
'parrot': Requested bean is currently in creation: Is there an unresolvable circular reference?
