### Spring Starts Here ###

This chapter covers:

	• Establishing relationship among beans
	• Using dependency injection
	• Accessing the beans from the Spring context through dependency injection

We will start by implementing a relationship between two beans, we'll define in the configuration class by using the
@Bean annotation. Here are two ways you can establish the relationships among beans:

	• Link beans by directly calling the methods that create them (which we'll call wiring)
	• Enable Spring to provide us a value using a method parameter (which we'll call auto-wiring)


In this exercise, we just added in the Person Bean (in ProjectConfig) a direct call to the Parrot Bean.
That tells Spring that we want to establish a connection between these Beans.

Output:
Person's name is: Jose
Parrot's name is: Donatello
Person's parrot: Parrot name = 'Donatello'
