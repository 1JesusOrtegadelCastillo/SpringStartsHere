### Spring Starts Here ###

First book exercise is about:
- Understand Spring modularity which means that you do not need to add the whole Spring ecosystem to your project,
  you just need to add those pieces that you really need (in matter of dependencies).
- Knowing how Spring context interacts and manage your instances.
- How to add an instance object(Bean) into Spring Context to get Spring functionalities using @Bean annotation.

Changes:

Also, you can set a name to a @Bean using name = "", value = "" or just writing the @Bean name inside ""

Ex: @Bean(value = "name")
    @Bean(name = "name")
    @Bean("name")

and then, you can use that name to call a @Bean from the Spring Context.
