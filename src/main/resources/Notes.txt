### Spring Starts Here ###

First book exercise is about:
- Understand Spring modularity which means that you do not need to add the whole Spring ecosystem to your project,
  you just need to add those pieces that you really need (in matter of dependencies).
- Knowing how Spring context interacts and manage your instances.
- How to add an instance object(Bean) into Spring Context to get Spring functionalities using @Bean annotation.

Changes:

Added 2 new Beans into ProjectConfig just to understand that Spring will also manage them.
When you call those methods from the main class, an explicit casting is not needed since Spring
looks for a Bean of the type you requested in its context. If a Bean does not exists, Spring
will throw an Exception.
