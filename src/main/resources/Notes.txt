Using Stereotype annotations to add beans to the Spring Context.

- How to add an instance object(Bean) into Spring Context to get Spring functionalities using stereotype annotation.

On last exercises we've created three object instances of the same type and called them from their name (Bean name).

There is another option when referring to beans in the context when you have more than 1 of the same type.
When you have multiple beans of the same type in the Spring Context, you can set a PRIMARY bean using the
@Primary annotation. A "Primary Bean" is the one Spring Context will choose if it has multiple options (multiple
beans of the same type) and you don't specify a name. In other words, the primary bean is simply a Spring's default
choice.

In this example, I've added @Primary annotation to my first bean and modified the main method to just ask for a
Bean of type Parrot. Normally this would throw an exception, but thanks to the @Primary annotation, Spring context
knows which is the default value and it will use that.
