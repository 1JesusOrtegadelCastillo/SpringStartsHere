### Spring Starts Here ###

This chapter covers:

	• Establishing relationship among beans
	• Using dependency injection
	• Accessing the beans from the Spring context through dependency injection

We will start by implementing a relationship between two beans, we'll define in the configuration class by using the
@Bean annotation. Here are two ways you can establish the relationships among beans:

	• Link beans by directly calling the methods that create them (which we'll call wiring)
	• Enable Spring to provide us a value using a method parameter (which we'll call auto-wiring)

Wiring by method parameter.

Instead of directly calling the method that defines the bean we wish to refer to, we add a parameter to the method of 
the corresponding type object, and we rely on Spring to provide us a value through that parameter.

This approach is a bit more flexible than the one we discussed.

With this approach, it doesn't matter if the bean we want to refer to is defined with a method annotated with @Bean or 
using a stereotype annotation like @Configuration. However it's not necessary this flexibility that makes developers 
use this approach; it's mostly the taste of each developer that determines which approach they use when working with 
beans. I wouldn't say one is better than the other, but you'll encounter both approaches in real-world scenarios, so 
you need to understand and be able to use them.
