### Spring Starts Here ###

This chapter covers:

	• Establishing relationship among beans
	• Using dependency injection
	• Accessing the beans from the Spring context through dependency injection

We will start by implementing a relationship between two beans, we'll define in the configuration class by using the
@Bean annotation. Here are two ways you can establish the relationships among beans:

	• Link beans by directly calling the methods that create them (which we'll call wiring)
	• Enable Spring to provide us a value using a method parameter (which we'll call auto-wiring)


@Autowired to inject values through the constructor

If you are using Spring 4.3 and above, you can omit the @Autowired annotation over the constructor and do this:

    public Person(Parrot parrot){
        this.parrot = parrot;
    }

and it's going to work.

Output:

Person's name: Tengen
Person parrot's name: Parrot 'Giyu'
