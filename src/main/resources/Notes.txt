### Spring Starts Here ###

This chapter covers:

	• Establishing relationship among beans
	• Using dependency injection
	• Accessing the beans from the Spring context through dependency injection

We will start by implementing a relationship between two beans, we'll define in the configuration class by using the
@Bean annotation. Here are two ways you can establish the relationships among beans:

	• Link beans by directly calling the methods that create them (which we'll call wiring)
	• Enable Spring to provide us a value using a method parameter (which we'll call auto-wiring)


It's actually quite easy to test this behavior. Just add a non-args constructor to the Parrot class and
print a message into the console from it. How many times will the message be printed in the console?
If the behavior is correct, you'll see the message only once.

Output:

Parrot created
Person's name is: Jose
Parrot's name is: Donatello
Person's parrot: Parrot name = 'Donatello'

So, as you can see, the Parrot was created just once.
